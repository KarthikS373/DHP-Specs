Too narrow domains will result in a large number of registry entries for each DHP Provider. It is recommended that network facilitators actively collaborate with various working groups and network participants to carefully choose domain codes keeping in mind relevance, performance, and opportunity cost. It is recommended that networks choose broad domains like mobility, logistics, healthcare etc, and progressively granularize them as and when the number of network participants for each domain grows large."

During a transaction, the DHP Provider reserves the right to decide the terms of payment. However, the Consumer can send its terms to the Provider first. If the Provider does not agree to those terms, it must overwrite the terms and return them to the Consumer. If overridden, the Consumer must either agree to the terms sent by the Provider in order to preserve the provider's autonomy, or abort the transaction. In case of such disagreements, the Consumer and the Provider can perform offline negotiations on the payment terms. Once an agreement is reached, the Consumer and Provider can resume transactions.

    Tag:
      description: Describes a tag. This is used to contain extended metadata. This object can be added as a property to any schema to describe extended attributes. For DHP Consumers, tags can be sent during search to optimize and filter search results. DHP Providers can use tags to index their catalog to allow better search functionality. Tags are sent by the DHP Provider as part of the catalog response in the `on_search` callback. Tags are also meant for display purposes. Upon receiving a tag, DHP Consumers are meant to render them as name-value pairs. This is particularly useful when rendering tabular information about a product or service.

Sometimes, selection of catalog elements is not enough for the DHP Provider to confirm an order. For all such purposes, the DHP Provider can choose to send this object attached to any object in the catalog that is required to be sent while placing the order. This object can typically be sent at an item level or at the order level. The item level XInput will override the Order level XInput as it indicates a special requirement of information for that particular item. Hence the DHP Consumer must render a separate form for the Item and another form at the Order level before confirmation.
